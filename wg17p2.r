#daily infection trajectories reconstructed using the ZOE app data

  # Appears to be higher number of cases in whole pop compared with cautious pop (at peak approx double)
  # Variation at start of model for cautious is larger than whole pop?
  # Likely to be many more (max double) numbers of real cases than the ZOE app would predict
  # ZOE data not representative of whole pop

# The difference between the infected ratio at the pandemic peak
# between the cautious 10% and the total implies that if we had the
# ZOE app data reporting some number of infections, those
# people are half as likely to have Covid-19 than a randomly sampled person.
